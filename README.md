# What is it?

This tutorial walks through the steps needed to enable Eco Mode on OpenEVSE with solar power produced from an Enphase system.

## What is Eco Mode?

Eco Mode (or "Solar Production" as labled on my OpenEVSE web server) enables OpenEVSE to charge your vehicle using excess solar energy.

## Eco Mode can...

1. ...save you money if your net metering agreement pays any less than 100%.

2. ...allow you to use greener energy if your energy company sends any power generated from legacy methods.

3. ...ever so slightly increase grid resiliency by reducing grid load.

# How do I do it?

## Prerequisites

1. A native Home Assistant Operating System installation (not Home Assistant Container or Home Assistant Core)

2. An Enphase Envoy system owned by you

3. An OpenEVSE owned by you

## Install MQTT broker

## Enable MQTT integration

## Install Stream mqtt from Enphase Envoy add-on

## Configure automation for MQTT translation

## Configure MQTT on OpenEVSE
